Challenge Program:

    nanohttpd-javawebserver-2.2.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Challenge Question:

    Is there an algorithmic complexity vulnerability in time that would cause the servers' response
    time (on the reference platform) to an HTTP request to exceed the resource usage limit given 
    the input budget?

Additional background for question:

    The server can support multiple users but for this question assumes there is only one
    user interacting with the system in any vulnerability demonstration.

Input Budget:

    Maximum sum of the PDU sizes of the TCP requests sent from the user to the server: 5000 bytes
    
Resource Usage Limit:

    Runtime: 300 seconds measured as the time interval between sending the last byte of the attack 
    and the server sending the last byte of the response.
