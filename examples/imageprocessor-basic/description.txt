Overview
========
This application could be a component of a social media service like
Facebook or Google+ that can be trained to apply appropriate tags
automatically to an image.

Any user can post an image to the social media service for
classification, at which point it is passed to this program using the
"cluster" command.  A posted image using "cluster" is classified
according to one or more tags on the training images.  Any user can
also add a tag to some existing image in the training image library
using the "train" command.  However, public users cannot add new
images to the library of training images.
