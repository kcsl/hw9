Challenge Program:

    ipchallenge-0.1.jar

Challenge Question:

    Is there an algorithmic complexity vulnerability in time that would cause the real 
    runtime of the challenge program (on the reference platform) to exceed the resource 
    usage limit given the input budget?

Additional background for question:

    None

Input Budget:

    Total size of input commands to the challenge program including the classification image files submitted: 70000 bytes
    
Resource Usage Limit:

    Runtime: 1080 seconds measured from the submission of the last user command to the completion
             of the application's processing of the command.
