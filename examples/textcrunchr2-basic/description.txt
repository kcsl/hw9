General Description
===================
TextCrunchr is a text analysis program. It can perform some useful analysis (word frequency, word length,
etc...) and includes some fun stuff too (automatic enigma encryption of input). TextCrunchr can process 
plain text files and can handle compressed files as well (which it will uncompress to analyze the contents). 
Researchers at Zooomblr (a startup search company) are using it in the back-end to analyze a large corpus 
of data from the Internet. These researchers have set up a web crawler to download pages and compressed 
files from various websites. The files from those websites are automatically fed into TextCrunchr which 
emits the results of the analysis (which can be console, xml or graphical).

Given a zip, bz2, or tar file that contains text files, TextCrunchr will analyze each file.
